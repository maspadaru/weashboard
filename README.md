# Weashboard
**Vue Frontend Challenge — “Weather Dashboard”**  

## Task 
Build a small Vue 3 app that lets a user search for a city and displays its current weather conditions using a public API.  

**Requirements:**  
1. **Search bar** where the user can type a city name.  
2. On submit, make a request to a **public weather API** (e.g., OpenWeatherMap’s free API).  
3. Display:  
   - City name & country  
   - Current temperature (°C)  
   - Weather description (e.g., “clear sky”)  
   - An icon representing the weather  
4. Show a **loading state** while fetching data.  
5. Show an **error message** if the city is not found or the API request fails.  
6. Bonus: Keep a **search history** of the last 5 cities and allow clicking them to reload their weather.
